# ssds-deno

Some Specialized Data Structures for Deno.

`ssds-deno` is a collection of specialized, efficient data structures for
Deno, written in TypeScript. These are likely to be most useful in
implementing certain algorithms.

Currently, this project is very early in development. Though extensive
testing is done, expect the occasional bug or unimplemented feature.

## Installation

The modules exports are located in the `./mod.ts` file.

## Testing

Tests are located in the `./tests` folder. Simply `cd` there and
use `deno test` to run all the tests.

For some of the structures, the tests will include reports on the
time taken to perform certain operations. These might be useful in
evaluating the efficiency of the implementations.
